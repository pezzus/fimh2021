# Random ECGs

We present a method to efficiently evaluate the uncertainty in bidomain-based ECGs (mean, covariance)
when the position of the electrodes is uncertain.  The strategy is based on the lead field approach
and a low-rank decomposition of the covariance matrix.  The implementation is done in FEniCS.
